# Hi, I'm Rad <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="35"></h1>


I'm a software developer focused on building interactive web experiences, visualizations, and small-scale distributed and algorithmic systems. I enjoy turning ideas into working demos and learning new tools and languages along the way.

## 🔭 What I do
- Build front-end and full-stack projects using JavaScript / TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Prototype algorithms, simulations, and visualizations (Boids, Minesweeper solver, audio emotion visualizer).
- Explore systems and research-oriented projects in Python (distributed streaming, ML detectors).

## 🛠️ Tech & tools
- Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS, TeX
- Tools: Node.js, npm, browser APIs, common web toolchains; basic Docker usage
- Areas: Front-end development, data/visualization, algorithms, small ML/ML-prototype projects

## 🤝 Collaborate / Contact
- Best way to reach me is via GitHub: open an issue or a PR on any repo, or send a message from my profile.
- If you'd like to collaborate or have suggestions, I'm open to small projects, learning-focused collaborations, and mentorship opportunities.
