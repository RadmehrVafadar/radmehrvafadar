# Hi, I'm Rad <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="35"></h1>


I'm a software developer focused on building interactive web experiences, visualizations, and small-scale distributed and algorithmic systems. I enjoy turning ideas into working demos and learning new tools and languages along the way.

- If you'd like to collaborate or have suggestions, I'm open to small projects, learning-focused collaborations, and mentorship opportunities.
